h1. splash - because mongodb is fun :)

h2. Faq

h3. What is it?

A wrapper around the "mongo ruby driver":http://api.mongodb.org/ruby/ .

h3. What are the advantages in comparison to use the bare driver?
* With the bare driver you save and load nested hashes. With splash you load and save document structures as complex as you like.
* Writing queries gets a lot more comfortable and you can abstract writing queries using scopes.
* Single table inheritance is build in.
* Map reduce becomes your friend.
More to come ...


h3. Okay, i've seen that on other gems

True. The problem, this gem tries to solve, is very common and so there are many different approaches. Yet, I was not really satisfied with most of them, so I created my own.
